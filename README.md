## Introduction
Welcome to the Flappy Bird project! This is a simple yet addictive game where the point is to implement NEAT funciontions in order to train neural network to avoid obstacles. This project is a clone of the popular Flappy Bird game.

## Features
- Classic Flappy Bird visuals
- Score tracking
- Realistic physics and collision detection
- Retro graphics and sound effects

## Installation
To play the test code locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DoubleLane/Flappy-Bird-.git
    cd Flappy-Bird-
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the project:
    ```bash
    python flappy_bird.py
    ```

## Usage
After installation, you can start the project by running the `flappy_bird.py` script. The window will open, and you can see many birds initially. After a few attempts, the best bird(s) should be trained enough to sustain endless amounts of obstacles.
